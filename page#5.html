<h1>TIPS TO AVOID BAD STRESS</h1>

<p>Bad stress is very common this day and age especially if you are an adult but that does not mean you cannot avoid it as much as possible. Here are some ways you can do to avoid bad stress or distress as much as possible:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Take some rest:</strong> Give yourself some time to process things and sit down and don't mind anything for a brief period. That should be give you enough momentum to get back on your feet and think of a way to solve your problems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Breathe:</strong> A lot of people don't take notice of their breathing capacity when they are anxious or worrying. Taking a subtle moment to give your breathing as much leeway as it needs to get you calmed down and eased.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Go out:</strong> When people think of a place to take a break they automatically think of going out; go out catch a break, give yourself some well-deserved rest after a long fought battle against stress.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Spend time with friends and family:</strong> Surely when people are at their lowest you might think they would need company; spending time with friends and family gets your mind cleared and have people to express your bottled up emotions and after that you feel relieved, almost as if a burden was taken out of your shoulders.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do something you love:</strong> By doing so, you can calm yourself down enough to get the desired amount of open-mindedness to give a positive feedback to any of your problems, and perhaps a way to solve them.
  </li>
</ol>
