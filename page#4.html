<p>Distress refers to negative or harmful stress that exceeds an individual's ability to cope with or adapt to a particular situation. It is often associated with feelings of anxiety, overwhelm, and a sense of being unable to handle the demands or pressures placed on oneself.</p>

<p>Distress can arise from various sources, such as work-related stress, relationship problems, financial difficulties, health issues, or traumatic events. Unlike eustress, which can be beneficial and motivating, distress can have detrimental effects on physical and mental health if not effectively managed.</p>

<p>The effects of distress can manifest in several ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Physical symptoms:</strong> Distress can lead to physical symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, muscle tension, sleep disturbances, digestive problems, and weakened immune system. Prolonged distress can increase the risk of developing chronic health conditions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Emotional and psychological symptoms:</strong> Distress can contribute to emotional and psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, irritability, mood swings, feelings of helplessness or hopelessness, difficulty concentrating, and decreased self-esteem.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Impaired cognitive functioning:</strong> Distress can impair cognitive functioning, making it difficult to think clearly, make decisions, and solve problems effectively. It can also interfere with memory and concentration.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Behavioral changes:</strong> Distress can lead to changes in behavior, such as withdrawal from social activities, increased use of substances (e.g., alcohol, drugs) as a coping mechanism, changes in appetite (overeating or loss of appetite), and difficulty in maintaining healthy relationships.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Impact on overall well-being:</strong> Prolonged distress can have a significant negative impact on overall well-being, affecting various areas of life including work performance, relationships, and quality of life. It can lead to feelings of burnout, decreased motivation, and a sense of being overwhelmed.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to recognize and address distress in order to prevent its negative consequences. Effective stress management techniques, such as relaxation exercises, mindfulness practices, seeking support from loved ones or professionals, and making lifestyle changes, can help individuals cope with distress and reduce its impact on their well-being.</p>
