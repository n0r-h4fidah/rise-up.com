<h1>WHAT IS STRESS</h1>
<p><e><font color="blue">Stress</font></e> is a natural response that our body and mind experience when we perceive a threat or demand. It is the body's way of reacting to a challenge or a difficult situation. Stress can be caused by various factors such as <font color="blue">work pressure, financial problems, relationship issues, or major life changes</font>. It can manifest in both physical and psychological symptoms, including increased heart rate, muscle tension, irritability, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating. While some level of stress is normal and can even be motivating, excessive or chronic stress can have negative effects on our health and well-being. It is important to manage stress through healthy coping mechanisms such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and seeking support from loved ones or professionals if needed.</p>
